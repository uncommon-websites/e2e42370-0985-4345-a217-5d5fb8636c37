    "prompt": "A cinematic, editorial-style photograph inside a premium underground club, featuring a small group of stylish people in their 20s to 30s, mid-shot, candidly immersed in conversation and laughter. The environment is defined by rich architectural details: exposed brick, art deco touches, and atmospheric neon accent lighting in deep teals, purples, and magentas. High contrast lighting with deep shadows and glowing highlights, subtle haze catching beams of colored light, and natural skin tones. The composition uses layered depth, with subjects framed off-center and environmental elements in foreground and background. Slight film grain adds texture, and the overall mood is one of anticipation and connection—magnetic, intimate, and sophisticated, evoking the authentic energy of an electronic music night.
